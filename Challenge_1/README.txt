Our best model is the ensemble of two models:
Transfer Learning on EfficientNetV2L
Transfer Learning on Xception

BM_EfficientNetV2L.ipynb : the first network
BM_Xception.ipynb: the second network
Ensemble.py: the ensemble model
Report.pdf: the three-page report 

Then, we thought to share also the neural network that we have created:
From_Scratch.ipynb
